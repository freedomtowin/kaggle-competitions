## Kaggle Competition - M5 Forecasting Competition - Accuracy

The final resulted used an ensemble of two neural network models: 1) a pricing-based dense network for each deptarment and store 2) an pattern model using LSTMs for each time series cluster (time series were clustered on the correlation matrix)

The result was achieved with neural networks while light gradient boosted machines were the favorite among competitors in this competition. 

Private Score: Top 7%: 386/5558

## Kaggle Competition - Predict Future Sales

Predict Future Sales: The final project for "How to win a data science competition" Coursera course, part 2 of the advanced machine learning specialization. The goal is to predict the monthly sales of items in each shop for the month of Novemeber. There are 33 months of daily item-shop data given in the training dataset.

The final solution effectively uses ID and categorical columns for feature creation, validation, and ensemble models. It combined results from boosted decision trees built on different categorical features.

Public Score: Top 1%: 79/8953
